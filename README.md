# MyNotes App

## A note-making Android project made with Flutter

## What is MyNotes

MyNotes starts as a summer project whose main goal was to learn the basics of Dart and Flutter and get to know the mobile development.

This project initially started with the Complete Flutter Course provided by FreeCodeCamp.org. After finishing the course the project continued to be updated and new features have been added.

## Features

- Authentication Firebase system
- Create/Read/Upate/Delete notes
- Notes can be shared easily using the share_plus dependency

## What I learnt

- Dart basics: syntax, null safety & OOP
- Async programming: Future, FutureBuilder, async and await.
- How to perform a Flutter project setup
- Firebase Backend Setup
- Flutter: widgets, manage different views and testing
- Error Handling in Flutter
- Creating own Auth Service
- CRUD Local Storage & Cloud Firestore to store the notes written by the users
- Work with dependencies added from [pub.dev](https://pub.dev)
- Using Bloc to add layers of abstraction between UI and the Auth Service
- Managing app icons, name and splash screen
- Setting up and releasing the Android App via the Google Play Console
- Localization in Flutter
